How has the DALYs changed in the UK over time?
From lines 33 to 37 of the code, I look up the data for the United Kingdom and plot a plot using the plot function. 
As can be seen from the figure, DALYs in Britain showed a trend of first decreasing and then basically maintaining the same.
And this is exactly what we expected, because with the improvement of the medical level in the UK, the DALYs value should show a downward trend. 
After a certain level of decline, it basically stays the same.
